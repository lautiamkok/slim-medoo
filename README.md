## Notes

1. [Operation timed out (IPv6 issues)](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#operation-timed-out-ipv6-issues-). On linux, it seems that running this command helps to make ipv4 traffic have a higher prio than ipv6, which is a better alternative than disabling ipv6 entirely:

`$ sudo sh -c "echo 'precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100' >> /etc/gai.conf"`

2. Run `$ sudo composer self-update` regularly.
